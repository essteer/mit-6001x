# Some pragmatic hints for debugging

- look for the usual suspects

- ask why the code is doing what it is, not why it is not doing what you want

- the bug is probably not where you think it is, so eliminate locations

- explain the problem to someone else

- don't trust documentation

- take a break and come back to the bug later
